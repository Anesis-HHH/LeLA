# Contributing to LeLA

We love pull requests from everyone. 
In fact, since we don't have much time for coding, any pull request is very welcome!

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to this [GitHub Repository][github]. 
Even better you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

This project came from a NSFW website but it is meant to be freed from any NSFW content in it's future.
